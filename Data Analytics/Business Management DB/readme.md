# Data Analytics for Business Management

## Project Outline
We all love a good pizza! However, it takes more than love to create a business. This project outlines the needs of a hypothetical business, “Ben’s Pizza”, and the visualizations I created to help the business owner, Ben, monitor his order activity and inventory, and manage his staff efficiently.

## Project Brief
The client, Ben, is opening a takeout and delivery pizzeria in his hometown. 
<ol>
  <li>Design and build a tailormade, bespoke relational database for his business, that will capture and store all the information and data that the business generates</li>
  <li>Help Ben monitor business performance using Dashboards</li>
</ol>
 

There are three main areas Ben requires us to focus on:
<ul>
  <li>Orders</li>
  <li>Inventory</li>
  <li>Staff</li>
</ul>
