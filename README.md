## More About Cynthia!
Hello, and welcome to my data portfolio! 

My name is Cynthia and I am a formally trained Biochemist and Data Professional. I began my data journey in 2016 as an undergraduate research fellow at the University of Lethbridge. During my time at the U of L, I investigated the relationship between genetic material and various diseases using computational chemistry and laboratory techniques. 

Today, I focus my data analytics and programming schools on solving any problem that comes my way. I'm always open to collaborate and learn from others, and can be reached professionally via [E-mail](mailto:cynthiafonderson@gmail.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiafonderson/).

Have fun looking though these projects!
