### [Investigating the relationship between estrogen metabolites and cancer](https://github.com/cfonderson/Portfolio/blob/main/Research/estrogen_poster.png)
I applied molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural changes estrogen metabolites associated with breast and endometrial cancers cause impose on our genetic material (DNA) <br>
